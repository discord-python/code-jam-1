A Discord bot that:

- Finds snek species on the [ITIS database](https://itis.gov/) 🐍

- Lets you hatch snek eggs for your very own snek collection ≧◡≦
- Draws random sneks using Perlin noise 🖌️
- Plays snek rattles in your voice channel, on demand 🔊

- Snakes and Ladders:
  - Create a game using `bot.sal create` (the author can cancel the game using `bot.sal cancel`)
  - Others join the game using `bot.sal join` (players can leave using `bot.sal leave`)
  - The author starts the match using `bot.sal start`
  - When a round begins, players use `bot.roll` to roll the dice
